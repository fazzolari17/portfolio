Although seemingly innocuous losing a few milliseconds every iteration of a setTimeout() or setInterval() leads to a very innacurate clock, rather quickly,  if not handled. This was a fun project and I learned a lot about keeping time and continually updating a component without triggering a rerendering of multiple unintended components, in React, while managing state.',
