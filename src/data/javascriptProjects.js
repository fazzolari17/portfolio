    description: `A mock patient diagnoses app written in TypeScript that tracks patients and different diagnoses when they visit a doctor/hospital. The app utilizes forms to add patients and patient diagnoses, modals to collect information as well as type and information verification when new data is added. Data that does not pass the validation tests in the form prevent the form from being submitted and display a message alerting the user to the incorrect and/or required fields. Sometimes it takes a minute to populate the data on this app, I guess that is due to me hosting the backend on a free service. It will populate with the existing data and allow you to add additional data in about a min.`,

Users can sign up, and once they sign in they are able rate the repositories and comment them. In order to demo this app you will have to tun it locally. I have not found an easy or free way to host this online yet. The setup instructions will be in the README file.`,

  description: 'This app showcased keeping accurate time and the time drift that occurs with a setTimeout() or setInterval() as a timekeeper. Although seemingly innocuous losing a few milliseconds every iteration of a setTimeout() or setInterval() leads to a very innacurate clock, rather quickly,  if not handled. This was a fun project and I learned a lot about keeping time and continually updating a component without triggering a rerendering of multiple unintended components, in React, while managing state.',
